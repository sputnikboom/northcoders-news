The back end api that was build for and used in this project can be found [here](link).

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you should ensure that you have [Node v8.12](https://nodejs.org) installed.

For this project, you'll require the following dependencies:

```
"dependencies": {
    "@reach/router": "^1.2.1",
    "axios": "^0.18.0",
    "moment": "^2.22.2",
    "react": "^16.5.2",
    "react-dom": "^16.5.2",
    "react-scripts": "2.0.5"
  },
```

### Installing

1. Fork and clone this repository onto your own local machine


2. Install the required node dependencies
```
npm i
```

3. To run a test version of this website in-browser you can use the following script, which will open at localhost:3000.

```
npm start
```

If using Chrome, you may find it useful to use the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) extension which can make it easier to naviagte React components in the browser's developer tools.
